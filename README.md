# Agario
This is a recreation of the popular browser game Agar.io made with the SpigotMC plugin API in Minecraft. This game was developed and published in late 2016, and the release page can be seen here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/agario-minecraft-free-multi-arena-splitting-viruses.33456/ I'm now hosting the project here.
